The DrawSpot was created for the Ambient Screens course, where the goal was to harnass the power of all the screens that are already around us and make them do something usefull.
It is a shared screen drawing application that uses a public screen to display all the drawings made by the users.
The users draw on their mobile phones by visiting any website while connected to the DrawSpot wifi.
DrawSpot is made with node.js and belongs to [Adam Kemeny](http://adamk.net/), [Remy Petrona](https://portfolio.cr.utwente.nl/student/remypetrona/), [Boaz Vetter](http://boazvetter.nl/), Tom Morsink and myself.
