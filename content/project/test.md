> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. 

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
  * Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
  1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

    You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

    To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.
    Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.
    (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

This is no longer indented.

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

Need some text in between the lists in order to propperly render the task list...

- [ ] A task list item
- [ ] List syntax required
- [ ] Incomplete
- [x] Completed

This is a definition list:

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.

{{< figure src="/images/drawspot.jpg" title="Drawspot" caption="draw stuff" class="test" link="#drawspot" attr="adam kemeny" attrlink="#adam" alt="drawspotpic">}}

this is some text at the end of a card to see what the padding and margin of the paragraph will do
